# Dérive

## Site 1
•	What is the URL? www.skippingrockslab.com
•	How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc? I went to google and searched for a company that makes edible water bubbles for a project in another class.
•	How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way? The first impression of the website makes it appear to look current with the media playing in the background. However, when you look at the website font and layout it gives it a dated appearance. 
•	Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things? The website doesn’t have a dropdown navigation system. They have hypertext links to the other pages that you can explore. It is easy to use and simple to find things because they only have 4 options to choose from. 
•	What parts of the site are interactive? The only real interactive parts of the website are the hypertext that you can click to take you to the page you’re interested in reading.
•	How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful? Honestly this site feels very boring and generic. It makes me feel as though they have only put on the basic information needed just to say they have a website. It is not beautiful at all. The colouring is bland, and the only interesting part of the site is the video playing in the background.
•	What is one thing you would change about this site? There is more than one thing that I would change about this website. I would implement a better navigation system so that it doesn’t make the site seem so generic. The choice in font is a very interesting. They’ve used the same font throughout most of the pages on the site. The addition of headers and sub-headings would make the pages stand out more. Different colours of text could help to brighten up the website as well.

## Site 2
•	What is the URL? www.jewlr.ca
•	How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc? I typed in the website in my browser because of the ad I came across on my Facebook feed that came up as an ad.  
•	How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way? The design of the website has a current and trendy appearance. The use of various fonts, colour schemes and images give the viewer a few different eye-catching locations. The large banner in the middle of the page allows the viewer to focus on their current promotion.
•	Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things? The website doesn’t have a dropdown navigation system like most. They have hypertext links to the other pages that you can explore. When you hover over top there are drop down lists that you can click to go to a specific page with certain jewellery to view. It is easy to use and simple to find things because they give you the options without having to go through multiple pages to find what you’re looking for. 
•	What parts of the site are interactive? Majority of the website is interactive. If you scroll down the index page, you’re able to click the hypertext to take you to a certain location. The website allows you to click on certain items to customize. The website updates the piece of jewellery that you’re looking at to give the viewer an idea of what their order will look like. If a potential customer wants to see what a ring with a specific engrave message will look like and I think that is very important as a consumer so there are no surprises and any spelling errors can be corrected before ordering.
•	How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful? I really like this website because of the interaction choices that can be made. I like the bold choice of colours and font. I feel like the options they present can be a bit overwhelming if it’s a potential consumer’s first visit. It’s better to have more options and a well planned out website than a generic feeling one.
•	What is one thing you would change about this site? I don’t feel like I would change anything about the website because you have access to everything you would need. There is a search bar, hypertexts to frequently asked questions, social media connections and a button to bring you back to the top of the page.

## Site 3
•	What is the URL? www.ticketmaster.ca
•	How did you get there? Did you follow a link from another site, from social media, from a search engine, etc? I went to google and searched for Ticketmaster to look up concert tickets available.
•	How does it look? Does the design seem current, trendy, dated, timeless, etc? What makes it appear that way? The first impression of the website makes it appear to look dated and timeless because over the years it seems that they haven’t changed much on the website. The layout and text are the same as I remember when I first started by concert tickets from their website years ago. 
•	Describe the navigation system? Is it familiar or uncommon? Is it easy use and simple to find things? The website doesn’t have a dropdown navigation system like most.

•	What parts of the site are interactive? You’re able to click on specific sections of a stadium (when applicable) to chose which seats you want to purchase. The website also has ads that you can click to take you that company’s website or a specific page. 
•	How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful? Honestly, I feel as though Ticketmaster could update their colour scheme and font to make it seem trendier. They are one the most popular websites to purchase tickets from and many of their competitors (Stubhub for example) have vibrant colours and text that gives them more appeal.
•	What is one thing you would change about this site? I would change the colour scheme and font to keep up with the changes in society. Their website makes sense for them because they are trying to keep their original concept, but I feel as though simple things could make it seem more intriguing.

•	How do you feel about the site? Is it useful? Is it interesting? Is it beautiful? Honestly this site feels like it could have a little bit more to it for it being Apple. They pride themselves on being innovators in technology so I feel like the website could be a little “techier”. I would expect them to have brighter and bolder colours as well as a font that would grab more attention.
•	What is one thing you would change about this site? There isn’t a lot that I would change about Apple’s website. I think the one thing that comes to mind would be to open the page up a bit more and not have so many product options blocked together.
